# IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate
This repo consists of my lab solutions, projects, and notebooks for IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate on Coursera.

### About the certificate
The IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate consists of 6 courses that provide solid theoretical understanding and considerable practice of the main algorithms, uses, and best practices related to Machine Learning. The Professional Certificate has a strong emphasis on developing the skills that help advance a career in Machine Learning. All the courses include a series of hands-on labs and final projects.

Throughout this Professional Certificate, I gained exposure to a series of tools, libraries, cloud services, datasets, algorithms, assignments and projects that provide practical skills with applicability to Machine Learning jobs. These skills include:

### Tools: Jupyter Notebooks and Watson Studio
### Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, Keras, and TensorFlow.

Courses:
Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning
Supervised Machine Learning: Regression
Supervised Machine Learning: Classification
Unsupervised Machine Learning
Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
Machine Learning Capstone
